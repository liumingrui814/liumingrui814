### Do not go gentle into that good night.ðŸŒ™
Over hill and under tree,
through lands where never light has shone,
by silver streams that run down to the sea.
To these memories I will hold,
with your blessing I will go
to turn at last to paths that lead home.
And though where the road then takes me, I cannot tell.
